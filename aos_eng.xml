But when the damage would be too great or no other option to survive - it can also destroy using cannons. Unique in versatility - they often had many contacts to buy or sell ships quickly, so could even appear somewhere else to fight. It\'s also often more safe to quickly get rid of war ships and just get easier transportable goods instead.</string>
	<string name="UNIT_TXT_CORSAIR_CAPTAIN">A specialist ship/crew for a hire.

	<string name="UNIT_TXT_HUSSAR_UPG1">Winged Polish Hussars, after investing quite extensively in lance technology got longest lances in entire history. They could outrange almost all polearm units, dealing devastating, fast attacks against them.
